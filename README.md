# ScheduleQuest.BackendPrototype
> **INFO:** This repisotory contains prototypes and research results for
> the scheduleQuest backend. While an effort is made to properly document
> the code and methods used, this project as a whole is not intended for further
> use, and should only be used for reference.

ScheduleQuest's backend is currently designed using Spring Boot, Gradle and JDBC to handle necessary 
functionalities. This prototype serves as an experimental model for exploring different approaches and will undergo
refactoring as further knowledge and insight is gained. Due to the limitations of IntelliJ Community Edition, the 
Spring Boot application was created using https://start.spring.io/.
